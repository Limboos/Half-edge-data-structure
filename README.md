# Hello Word!!
This is my first project at Git. I'm a student of the 1st year at Wrocław University of Science and Technology.  
I'm studying Geodesy and Cartography. I'm interested in programming (currently dealing with graphs).
In this project i create a data structure name "Hale Edge". This structure is really interesting.
I use this structure to create a graph. I use a Breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to traversing or searching graph.
Currently i am working on optimizing the code(the code is now in functional programing, but i want to change it to OOP).
