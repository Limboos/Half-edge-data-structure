# HalfEdge and QuadEdge data structure implementation!!
In this project i create a data structure name "Half Edge". 
This is a data structure to represent an embedding of a planar graph in the plane. Half Edge give us a good efficient in manipulation of the topological information.
 I use a Breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm and Dijkstra algorithm to traversing or searching graph.
I added Delanuy Triangulation and a visualization of the traingle mesh. I can travel on the edges using "w" for next edge, "s" for sym(other side of edge) edge, "e" for previous edge.
Currently working on adding more visualisation effects like next edge in triangle, and cleaning the code.
