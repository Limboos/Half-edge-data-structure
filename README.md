# Hello Word!!
In this project i create a data structure name "Half Edge". 
This is a data structure to represent an embedding of a planar graph in the plane. Half Edge give us a good efficient in manipulation of the topological information.
 I use a Breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm and Dijkstra algorithm to traversing or searching graph.
Currently i am working on optimizing the code(the code is now in functional programing, but i want to change it to OOP).
